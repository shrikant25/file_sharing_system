RETURN VALUE
       When successful, epoll_ctl() returns zero.  When an error occurs, epoll_ctl() returns -1 and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  epfd or fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EEXIST op was EPOLL_CTL_ADD, and the supplied file descriptor fd is already registered with this epoll instance.

       EINVAL epfd is not an epoll file descriptor, or fd is the same as epfd, or the requested operation op is not supported by this interface.

       EINVAL An invalid event type was specified along with EPOLLEXCLUSIVE in events.

       EINVAL op was EPOLL_CTL_MOD and events included EPOLLEXCLUSIVE.

       EINVAL op was EPOLL_CTL_MOD and the EPOLLEXCLUSIVE flag has previously been applied to this epfd, fd pair.

       EINVAL EPOLLEXCLUSIVE was specified in event and fd refers to an epoll instance.

       ELOOP  fd refers to an epoll instance and this EPOLL_CTL_ADD operation would result in a circular loop of epoll instances monitoring one another or a nesting depth of epoll instances greater than 5.

       ENOENT op was EPOLL_CTL_MOD or EPOLL_CTL_DEL, and fd is not registered with this epoll instance.

       ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to handle the requested op control operation.

       ENOSPC The limit imposed by /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches was encountered while trying to register (EPOLL_CTL_ADD) a new file descriptor on an epoll instance.  See  epoll(7)  for  further  de‚Äê
              tails.

       EPERM  The target file fd does not support epoll.  This error can occur if fd refers to, for example, a regular file or a directory.
