       On success, shmdt() returns 0; on error -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the cause of the error.

       EIDRM  shmid points to a removed identifier.

       EINVAL Invalid shmid value, unaligned (i.e., not page-aligned and SHM_RND was not specified) or invalid shmaddr value, or can't attach segment at shmaddr, or SHM_REMAP was specified and shmaddr  was
              NULL.

       ENOMEM Could not allocate memory for the descriptor or for the page tables.
