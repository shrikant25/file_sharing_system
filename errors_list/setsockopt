RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned for the standard options.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

       Netfilter  allows the programmer to define custom socket options with associated handlers; for such options, the return value on success is the value returned by
       the handler.

ERRORS
       EBADF  The argument sockfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EFAULT The address pointed to by optval is not in a valid part of the process address space.  For getsockopt(), this error may also be returned if optlen is  not
              in a valid part of the process address space.

       EINVAL optlen  invalid in setsockopt().  In some cases this error can also occur for an invalid value in optval (e.g., for the IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP option described
              in ip(7)).

       ENOPROTOOPT
              The option is unknown at the level indicated.

       ENOTSOCK
              The file descriptor sockfd does not refer to a socket.
