RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EACCES The address is protected, and the user is not the superuser.

       EADDRINUSE
              The given address is already in use.

       EADDRINUSE
              (Internet domain sockets) The port number was specified as zero in the socket address structure, but, upon attempting to bind to an ephemeral port, it was
              determined that all port numbers in the ephemeral port range are currently in use.  See the discussion of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range ip(7).

       EBADF  sockfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EINVAL The socket is already bound to an address.

       EINVAL addrlen is wrong, or addr is not a valid address for this socket's domain.

       ENOTSOCK
              The file descriptor sockfd does not refer to a socket.

       The following errors are specific to UNIX domain (AF_UNIX) sockets:

       EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.  (See also path_resolution(7).)

       EADDRNOTAVAIL
              A nonexistent interface was requested or the requested address was not local.

       EFAULT addr points outside the user's accessible address space.

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving addr.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              addr is too long.

       ENOENT A component in the directory prefix of the socket pathname does not exist.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       EROFS  The socket inode would reside on a read-only filesystem.
