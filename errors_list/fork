RETURN VALUE
       On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child.  On failure, -1 is returned in the parent, no child process is created, and errno is set appropri‚Äê
       ately.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN A system-imposed limit on the number of threads was encountered.  There are a number of limits that may trigger this error:

              *  the RLIMIT_NPROC soft resource limit (set via setrlimit(2)), which limits the number of processes and threads for a real user ID, was reached;

              *  the kernel's system-wide limit on the number of processes and threads, /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max, was reached (see proc(5));

              *  the maximum number of PIDs, /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max, was reached (see proc(5)); or

              *  the PID limit (pids.max) imposed by the cgroup "process number" (PIDs) controller was reached.

       EAGAIN The caller is operating under the SCHED_DEADLINE scheduling policy and does not have the reset-on-fork flag set.  See sched(7).

       ENOMEM fork() failed to allocate the necessary kernel structures because memory is tight.

       ENOMEM An attempt was made to create a child process in a PID namespace whose "init" process has terminated.  See pid_namespaces(7).

       ENOSYS fork() is not supported on this platform (for example, hardware without a Memory-Management Unit).

       ERESTARTNOINTR (since Linux 2.6.17)
              System call was interrupted by a signal and will be restarted.  (This can be seen only during a trace.)
