ERRORS

       EINVAL sem is not a valid semaphore.

       The following additional error can occur for sem_trywait():

       EAGAIN The operation could not be performed without blocking (i.e., the semaphore currently has the value zero).

       The following additional errors can occur for sem_timedwait():

       EINVAL The value of abs_timeout.tv_nsecs is less than 0, or greater than or equal to 1000 million.

       ETIMEDOUT
              The call timed out before the semaphore could be locked.
