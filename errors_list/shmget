RETURN VALUE
       On success, a valid shared memory identifier is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       On failure, errno is set to one of the following:

       EACCES The user does not have permission to access the shared memory segment, and does not have the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability in the user namespace that governs its IPC namespace.

       EEXIST IPC_CREAT and IPC_EXCL were specified in shmflg, but a shared memory segment already exists for key.

       EINVAL A new segment was to be created and size is less than SHMMIN or greater than SHMMAX.

       EINVAL A segment for the given key exists, but size is greater than the size of that segment.

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENOENT No segment exists for the given key, and IPC_CREAT was not specified.

       ENOMEM No memory could be allocated for segment overhead.

       ENOSPC All possible shared memory IDs have been taken (SHMMNI), or allocating a segment of the requested size would cause the system to exceed the system-wide limit on shared memory (SHMALL).

       EPERM  The SHM_HUGETLB flag was specified, but the caller was not privileged (did not have the CAP_IPC_LOCK capability).
