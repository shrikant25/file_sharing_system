RETURN VALUE
       When successful, epoll_wait() returns the number of file descriptors ready for the requested I/O, or zero if no file descriptor became ready during the requested timeout milliseconds.  When an error
       occurs, epoll_wait() returns -1 and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  epfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EFAULT The memory area pointed to by events is not accessible with write permissions.

       EINTR  The call was interrupted by a signal handler before either (1) any of the requested events occurred or (2) the timeout expired; see signal(7).

       EINVAL epfd is not an epoll file descriptor, or maxevents is less than or equal to zero.
