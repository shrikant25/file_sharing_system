PQresultStatus can return one of the following values:

PGRES_EMPTY_QUERY
The string sent to the server was empty.

PGRES_COMMAND_OK
Successful completion of a command returning no data.

PGRES_TUPLES_OK
Successful completion of a command returning data (such as a SELECT or SHOW).

PGRES_COPY_OUT
Copy Out (from server) data transfer started.

PGRES_COPY_IN
Copy In (to server) data transfer started.

PGRES_BAD_RESPONSE
The server's response was not understood.

PGRES_NONFATAL_ERROR
A nonfatal error (a notice or warning) occurred.

PGRES_FATAL_ERROR
A fatal error occurred.

PGRES_COPY_BOTH
Copy In/Out (to and from server) data transfer started. This feature is currently used only for streaming replication, so this status should not occur in ordinary applications.

PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE
The PGresult contains a single result tuple from the current command. This status occurs only when single-row mode has been selected for the query (see Section 34.6).

PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC
The PGresult represents a synchronization point in pipeline mode, requested by PQpipelineSync. This status occurs only when pipeline mode has been selected.

PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED
The PGresult represents a pipeline that has received an error from the server. PQgetResult must be called repeatedly, and each time it will return this status code until the end of the current pipeline, at which point it will return PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC and normal processing can resume.

If the result status is PGRES_TUPLES_OK or PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE, then the functions described below can be used to retrieve the rows returned by the query. Note that a SELECT command that happens to retrieve zero rows still shows PGRES_TUPLES_OK. PGRES_COMMAND_OK is for commands that can never return rows (INSERT or UPDATE without a RETURNING clause, etc.). A response of PGRES_EMPTY_QUERY might indicate a bug in the client software.

A result of status PGRES_NONFATAL_ERROR will never be returned directly by PQexec or other query execution functions; results of this kind are instead passed to the notice processor (see Section 34.13).
