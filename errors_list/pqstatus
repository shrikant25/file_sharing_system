At any time during connection, the status of the connection can be checked by calling PQstatus. If this call returns CONNECTION_BAD, then the connection procedure has failed; if the call returns CONNECTION_OK, then the connection is ready. Both of these states are equally detectable from the return value of PQconnectPoll, described above. Other states might also occur during (and only during) an asynchronous connection procedure. These indicate the current stage of the connection procedure and might be useful to provide feedback to the user for example. These statuses are:

CONNECTION_STARTED
Waiting for connection to be made.

CONNECTION_MADE
Connection OK; waiting to send.

CONNECTION_AWAITING_RESPONSE
Waiting for a response from the server.

CONNECTION_AUTH_OK
Received authentication; waiting for backend start-up to finish.

CONNECTION_SSL_STARTUP
Negotiating SSL encryption.

CONNECTION_SETENV
Negotiating environment-driven parameter settings.

CONNECTION_CHECK_WRITABLE
Checking if connection is able to handle write transactions.

CONNECTION_CONSUME
Consuming any remaining response messages on connection.
