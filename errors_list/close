RETURN VALUE
       close() returns zero on success.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd isn't a valid open file descriptor.

       EINTR  The close() call was interrupted by a signal; see signal(7).

       EIO    An I/O error occurred.

       ENOSPC, EDQUOT
              On NFS, these errors are not normally reported against the first write which exceeds the available storage space, but instead against a subsequent write(2), fsync(2), or close().

       See NOTES for a discussion of why close() should not be retried after an error.
